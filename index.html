<h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p> This page summarises how the universe expands; to start with, the Hubble's discovery that galaxies are moving away from us when their light is redshifted. This shows how the scale factor and Friedmann's equations display the growth of the Universe and illustrate the different possible shapes of the universe. It also highlights how matter density and dark energy can change the universe's evolution and its potential long-term fate.  
.</p>

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Our understanding of the universe has transformed dramatically since the early twentieth century.  Einstein's theory provides a new framework for describing gravity. On the other hand, Edwin Hubble's observations revealed the true scale of the cosmos. Galaxies beyond the Milky Way were moving away from us due to redshift, indicating that the universe is expanding. Hubble's law forms the foundations of modern cosmology. Building on these ideas, scientists utilise mathematical tools such as Friedmann's equations and the scale factor to illustrate how the universe expands and how its geometry is either flat, open, or closed, depending on its density. These ideas allow us to explore how the universe has evolved and what its ultimate fate may be. 

</p>

<h3 id="Analysis and Discussion">Analysis and Discussion</h3>
<p> <h2>Hubble’s Law and Redshift: Math of the Expanding Universe</h2>
  <p>
  
The Physics of the Universe (n.d.) describes that Albert Einstein had formulated his theory of gravity in the early 20th century, when astronomers knew only of our own galaxy. Einstein assumed the universe has the same gross properties everywhere and that it looks the same in every direction, regardless of where an observer is. In 1925, the American astronomer Edwin Hubble shocked the scientific community by showing that the universe was more than just the Milky Way galaxy. Later, in 1929, Hubble discovered that the light from these other galaxies was slightly shifted towards the red end of the spectrum due to the Doppler Effect. This shift, called 'redshift', wavelength increases that occurs when the source of light moves away from the observer. The Doppler shift is the change in wavelength of observed light due to relative motion between the wave source and the observer. After analysing the redshifts of a special class of stars called Cepheids, Hubble concluded that galaxies and clusters of galaxies were in fact flying apart at great speed, and therefore the universe was expanding. Thus, all galaxies we see are slightly redshifted. Hubble shows that in our expanding universe; every galaxy is moving farther away from us at a speed directly proportional to its distance. The Star Child Team (n.d.) states that Hubble's law is usually expressed as v = HoD, where v is the velocity of recession, D is the distance to the galaxy, and Ho is the Hubble constant that relates them. Although the exact value of the Hubble constant is still somewhat uncertain, it's believed to be around 65km/s/Mpc. (1Mpc = 3 x 10^6 parsecs, where a parsec is a unit of distance equal to about 3.26 light-years); indicating that a galaxy one megaparsec away is moving away from us at 65 km/sec, suggesting the universe is expanding.</p>

<h2>The Scale Factor: Measuring How the Universe Grows</h2>
  <p>
  
Peacock (1999) explains that the equation for the scale factor's motion is derived in a quasi-Newtonian manner. If we consider a sphere at some arbitrary point, we let the radius be R, where r is arbitrary. The motion of a point at the edge of the sphere will, in Newtonian gravity, be influenced only by the interior mass. We can write down immediately a differential equation, which is Friedmann's equations that expresses conservation of energy, r)2 / 2 - GM / (Rr) = constant. The Friedmann equation shows that a universe that is spatially closed (with k = +1) has negative total 'energy': the expansion will eventually halt due to gravity, and the universe will re-collapse. An unbound model is spatially open (k = -1) and will expand forever. Thus, the dynamics of the entire universe are the same as those of a cannonball fired vertically against the Earth's gravity. The Earth's gravity defines an escape velocity for projectiles, so a universe that expands fast will continue to expand forever.</p>

 <h2>Flat, Open, or Closed? The Geometry of the Universe</h2>
  <p>
  
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (2000) suggests when astronomers spoke about the universe as flat, open, or closed, referring to the density of the universe was either so great that it would eventually re-collapse due to gravitational attraction; or that its density was so low that gravity would be insufficient to keep it from expanding forever; or that its density was so delicately adjusted that it would neither expand nor contract. The terms 'closed', 'open', or 'flat' refer to the shape or curvature of space-time itself. Curvature describes how space bends under the influence of mass and energy. It's impossible to picture in three spatial dimensions; hence, it's easier in two: two-dimensional space with positive curvature would resemble the surface of a sphere, or a saddle (on which parallel lines diverge). A flat two-dimensional universe would resemble a sheet of paper (on which parallel lines stay parallel). Many independent observations indicate that the universe is flat. Inflation theory states that a small portion of the universe briefly underwent a rapid expansion shortly after the Big Bang-- which is favoured by cosmologists, not least because it explains a great many otherwise puzzling things, such as the remarkable smoothness and homogeneity of regions of space that have never been in contact--requires a flat universe. If the universe is flat and the density of matter is low--including visible matter, invisible matter, and ordinary energy--something must require missing density, which is the cosmological constant, or some other form of dark energy. The cosmological constant refers to a theoretical energy inherent to space itself that can drive the expansion of the universe. This invisible energy could propel even a closed universe to eternal expansion. If the cosmological constant is constant, the expansion of the universe will accelerate indefinitely.<p>

<h2>The Fate of the Universe: Math Predicts the End</h2>
  <p>
  
NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre (n.d.) explains that there are two possible fates for the universe: Endless expansion and the 'Big Crunch’. The evolution of the universe is determined by a struggle between the momentum of expansion and the pull (or push) of gravity. Currently, the rate of expansion is measured by the Hubble Constant, while the strength of gravity depends on the density and pressure of the matter of the universe. If the pressure of the matter is low, then the fate of the universe is governed by the density. If the density of the universe is less than the critical density, then the universe will expand forever, like the green or blue curves in the graph. Gravity might slow the expansion rate over time. For densities below the critical density, there's not enough gravitational pull from the material to ever stop or reverse the outward expansion. This is known as the Big Chill or Big Freeze, because the universe will slowly cool as it expands, until it's unable to sustain life. If the universe's density is greater than the critical density, gravity will eventually win, and the universe will collapse back on itself. This is called the Big Crunch, as shown by the orange curve on the graph. In this universe, there is sufficient mass to slow the expansion to a stop, and then eventually reverse it.<p>
